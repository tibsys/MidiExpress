# MidiExpress

MIDIExpress is an USB-MIDI project which offers USB connectivity for Jack expression/volume pedals. 

It consists in two subprojects: 
- An Arduino based device (schematics, firmware and software)
- A small configuration application

## Presentation

Here comes a schema of the pedal connection

## Use cases

## Arduino project

This project contains two parts:
- The Arduino module firmware which makes it a MIDI USB device [see section Firmware](#firmware).
- The Arduino code to behave as a MIDI expression pedal [see section Software](#software).

### Hardware and schematics

Here comes a schematics of the hardware used in this project (mainly an Arduino board)

### Firmware

Here comes a description of the firmware sub-project

### Software

Here comes a description of the software sub-project

## Configuration software

This software is coded in C++-11 with Qt5. It is designed to make some configuration in the Arduino board in order to change or fine-tune its behaviour.
